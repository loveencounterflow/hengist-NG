However, the egg only got larger and larger, and more and
more human: when she had come within a few yards of it,
she saw that it had eyes and a nose and mouth; and when
she had come close to it, she saw clearly that it was
HUMPTY DUMPTY himself. “It can’t be anybody else!” she
said to herself. “I’m as certain of it, as if his name
were written all over his face.”

It might have been written a hundred times, easily, on
that enormous face. Humpty Dumpty was sitting with his
legs crossed, like a Turk, on the top of a high wall—such
a narrow one that Alice quite wondered how he could keep
his balance—and, as his eyes were steadily fixed in the
opposite direction, and he didn’t take the least notice of
her, she thought he must be a stuffed figure after all.

“And how exactly like an egg he is!” she said aloud,
standing with her hands ready to catch him, for she was
every moment expecting him to fall.

“It’s very provoking,” Humpty Dumpty said after a long
silence, looking away from Alice as he spoke, “to be
called an egg—Very!”

“I said you looked like an egg, Sir,” Alice gently
explained. “And some eggs are very pretty, you know” she
added, hoping to turn her remark into a sort of a
compliment.

“Some people,” said Humpty Dumpty, looking away from her
as usual, “have no more sense than a baby!”

Alice didn’t know what to say to this: it wasn’t at all
like conversation, she thought, as he never said anything
to her; in fact, his last remark was evidently addressed
to a tree—so she stood and softly repeated to herself:—

“Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall:
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
All the King’s horses and all the King’s men
Couldn’t put Humpty Dumpty in his place again.”
